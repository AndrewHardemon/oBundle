# oBundle Cornerstone

## Description
This is my submission for oBundle's test application. In this repository you can see the history of me
- Adding a hover feature to each product to preview an alternate image
- Creating an Add All to Cart by Category button
- Creating a Remove All from Cart that only shows when cart is created
  - originally was designed to remove all of a category from cart but has been updated
- Added Custom banner displaying the user's name and city, state, country

The biggest thing I tried to acomplish was making sure the functionality worked across all items, and make the styling consistent with the oBundle Light theme and make sure any changes I made were mobile responsive.

## Future Development
1. Further improve the banner to change it's appearance and the information to shows for different screen sizes.
2. Fix the issue with items that use url-encoded characters. Right now there is one and it is ignored by the Add All to prevent errors.
3. Hovering over the buttons causes the image to revert back to it's original image.
