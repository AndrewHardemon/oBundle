# oBundle Cornerstone

## Description
This is my submission for oBundle's test application. In this repository you can see the history of me
- Adding a hover feature to each product to preview an alternate image
- Creating an Add All to Cart by Category button
- Creating a Remove All of a Category from Cart that only shows when cart is created
- Added Custom banner displaying the user's name and city, state, country

The biggest thing I tried to acomplish was making sure the functionality worked across all items.
The only exception is that some of the item names (one specifically) didn't play nice. So while it doesn't cause any errors. 
That is definitely something I would want to improve upon in future updates. 
I also tried to make the styling consistent with the oBundle Light theme and make sure any changes I made were mobile responsive. 
The banner specifically could be improved, but it was meant to be relatively simple.
